Requires constant hard work and personal time sacrifice especially during peak period: A HUGE mistake to undercut myself fr the start found out my peers got 2800 and above. Basic is important because it is your BULLET for future job search 1 & salary negotiation. Recruiters will say that the fixed allowances compensate the gap or even "exceed your expectation" but NO IT IS A TRAP those are allowances for ur travel essentials!!

Dont be afraidl Frankly; the working conditions in this 2 company are stressful and you are kept on your toes at all times There's ~ not a moment you can stop to breath and if there's a time you felt you have free time, think again, you are probably forgetting to do something_ Being based at center isn't that bad but if you ended up as a therapist 1 providing services in homes schools, good luck rushing back and fro between sessions and having a meal. Working with the kids are quite fun except when you get those can be quite aggressive (biting, grabbing, etc): But in this sector; you will always encounter them so what to do? And to be honest, there's up and downs with working here but the stress can be too 7 much to handle at times. When first started at this company; was offered 6.8k. Recently promoted to manager leading of a team of 25. think that the salary paid to hospital pharmacists does not reflect our workload: Most private hospitals only employ 1-2 pharmacists to meet the requirement of laws: The hospital pharmacist is in cbargethe FOsprectincfudiedicirgg 1 procurement, internal supply, the dispensing process, and patient counselling: plan and deliver training to pharmacy and nursing staff; manage department budgets, serve on several hospital committees, and conduct internal audits to ensure compliance with SOP; accreditation, and legal requirements. My advice: @malaysianpaygap Make sure you get your Phd before starting your career in lecturing: Starting pay is much higher (mostly with 6k and above) , and better treatment from management: Handling students (regardless young or older one) is nvr be easy as ABC. Students will expect you to spoon 1 feed them and will text you whenever they want (even mid night). That's even worse in ODL setting- If you are not being patient enough, please reconsider: Lastly; if you are not a research - oriented person, perhaps this path is not for you: they Also, our allowances are now taxablel (yay?) even more deductions compared to before. But even then, I'm glad that still have a well paying job that can support my family: Can't complain about job security 5 (since I'm still working) and to be honest, feel guilty to complain about my salary since understand that the aviation sector in Malaysia won't survive if the salary that feel is right.
